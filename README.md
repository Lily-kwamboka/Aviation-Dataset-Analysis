# OVERVIEW
## Purpose
This analysis aims to evaluate the safety records of various aircraft models, focusing on identifying those with the lowest risk for both commercial and private operations. The findings will assist the company in making informed purchasing decisions for its aviation division by minimizing risk exposure
## Scope
I will analyze civil aviation accident data, focusing on incidents involving commercial and private aircraft models. The analysis will highlight aircraft models with high reliability and safety and provide insights into the factors that contribute to low-risk profiles
#  Business Understanding
## Stakeholders:
Aviation Division Leadership: Responsible for making purchasing decisions for aircraft models.

Risk Management Team: Interested in minimizing risk exposure and ensuring the safety of operations.

Purchasing Department: Involved in sourcing aircraft that align with the companyâ€™s strategic goals of diversifying the portfolio
## Key Business Questions
Which aircraft models have the lowest safety-related incidents over time?

Are there any significant patterns in safety data related to aircraft model types or manufacturers?

What factors contribute to the likelihood of aircraft accidents and fatalities?

Which aircraft should the company consider purchasing to minimize exposure to aviation risks?
# Data Understanding and Analysis
## Source of Data:
The data is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database, which contains records of civil aviation accidents and incidents from 1962 to the present day. The dataset is available on Kaggle and provides valuable information about accidents, aircraft types, weather conditions, and other variables.

## Description of Data:
The dataset includes the following columns:

Event.Date: Date of the accident/incident.

Location: Geographical location of the accident.

Aircraft Make: The manufacturer of the aircraft (e.g., Boeing, Cessna).

Model: The specific model of the aircraft involved in the incident.

Injury Severity: Total fatalities, serious injuries, minor injuries, and uninjured passengers.

Engine Type: Type of engine (e.g., piston, jet).

Weather Conditions: The weather during the time of the incident.

Phase of Flight: Whether the incident occurred during takeoff, cruising, or landing.

Accident Severity: A classification of the severity of the accident (fatal, serious, minor).

## Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Data: We will handle any missing data by either imputing values or excluding rows where necessary.

Data Consistency: Ensure the consistency of model names, injury severity, and date formats.

Duplicates: Remove duplicate entries if any exist.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We will explore various aspects of the data, including:

Summary statistics on accident severity and injury types.

Trends over time in the number of accidents and injuries for different aircraft models.

Correlations between aircraft make/model, accident severity, and other factors like weather and flight phase.
